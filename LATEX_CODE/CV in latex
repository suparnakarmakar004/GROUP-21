\end{center}
% Step 1
\section*{1. Document Setup}
I started by selecting the document class as ‘article’ and set the font size to 10pt on A4 paper. I used the ‘geometry’ package to adjust the margins to 0.7 inches all around, ensuring a clean and spacious layout.

% Step 2
\section*{2. Adding Essential Packages}
To enhance the appearance and functionality of my CV, I imported several LaTeX packages:
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet, left=0pt]
    \item \texttt{geometry} for controlling the page layout.
    \item \texttt{enumitem} to customize the formatting of lists.
    \item \texttt{hyperref} for adding clickable links to my contact details.
    \item \texttt{xcolor} to define custom colors for text and accents.
    \item \texttt{fontawesome5} to include icons for my email, phone, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
\end{itemize}

% Step 3
\section*{3. Defining Custom Colors}
I created custom colors to make my CV visually appealing. I defined a ‘headerblue’ color for headings, a ‘darkgray’ color for general text, and an ‘accentcolor’ to give a modern touch to the underlines in the sections.

% Step 4
\section*{4. Formatting Fonts and Section Titles}
I chose a sans-serif font for a modern look and formatted the section titles to stand out by making them bold and coloring them blue. Subsections were colored in dark gray and underlined with a light pink accent for consistency.

% Step 5
\section*{5. Creating the Header}
In the header, I added my name in large text and centered it. Below, I listed my contact details, including email, phone number, GitHub, and LinkedIn, each accompanied by an icon to enhance visual engagement and accessibility.

% Step 6
\section*{6. Objective and Sections}
I included an objective statement at the top to summarize my skills and aspirations. I then structured sections like “Education,” “Skills,” and “Projects” with clear, bullet-pointed content to effectively highlight my qualifications and experiences.
